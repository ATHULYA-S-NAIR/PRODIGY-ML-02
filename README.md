K-Means Customer Segmentation Groups retail store customers based on purchase history to identify segments, optimize marketing, and enhance insights using Python.
# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

This project implements a K-means clustering algorithm to group retail store customers based on their purchase history. The goal is to identify customer segments, enabling better marketing strategies and insights into purchasing behaviors.

## Features
- Data preprocessing for clustering.
- K-means clustering using Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn).
- Visualization of clusters using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required Python libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to preprocess data and perform clustering.

## Applications
- Customer segmentation for targeted marketing.
- Analysis of purchase behaviors.
